        <h2> How has it been so far?</h2>
        <p>Well, pretty much intriguing. There were <strong>a lot</strong> of times when I just got lazy and wanted
        to copy and paste the whole tutorial and listen my way through them. Of course, the idea <em>sucked,</em> so 
    here I am, winning. <em>Hehe</em></p>
        </div>

        <div class="my-flaws">
            <div class="columns">
                <!--column 1-->
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>Sleep</h3>
                    <p>
                        Has to have been my biggest distraction. Still is, don't be deceived. But I'm learning a lot of 
    self control these days.</p>
                </div>

                <!--column 2-->
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>My mini mart</h3>
                    <p>
                        Another big distraction, but the ads are beginning to suffocate me, so I guess that won't be a problem.</p>
                </div>

                <!--column 3-->
                <div class="column">
                    <h3>The point?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I wasn't sure what to write, but this page needs to contain words. Soooooooooo ryuryiudysd yeyrwey rfds
            ytruysfr. I'm having so much fun. <em>Cries in italics.</em> </p>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <!--JSYK, I spent atleast an hour here. Because, the columns refused to be columns and I was sure I got everything
        right. Turns out, the C in "columns" was capitalized. Point? None. Learn the lessons YOU want to learn. Ciao-->
